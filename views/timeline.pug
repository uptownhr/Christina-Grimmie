            p.textwrap Adam Levine, who coached Christina during her competition in "The Voice", expressed his intentions to sign Grimmie on with "222 Records" and sign a record deal.  Fans of Grimmie wondered why she didn't outright sign on post-"The Voice".  According to "Sawdah" from "The Real Grimmie Blog", having to sign various contracts with NBC to be on the show, there may have been conflicts that did not allow Grimmie to sign with a competing record label: Universal Music Group vs Interscope Records (222 Records).  In the end, Grimmie signed on with Island Records where she released her new single "Must Be Love".

            p.textwrap Christina's new single, "Must Be Love", received mixed reviews but were generally negative.  The song did not make full use of her incredible voice and it did not seem like Island Records were interested in backing up the singer by promoting the release.  There were also other issues surrounding her signing.  There have been reports that Grimmie was concerned with pressures from various mediums to "sexualize" her and have her appear for performances "half naked".  Due to her wholesome Christian values, Christina refused and stated her rejection of having to dress a certain way to sell records.  Whether this pressure was coming from Island Records directly is speculated.

            p.textwrap After the release of the single "Must Be Love", on March 4, 2015, Island Records let Grimmie off the label so she can pursue other options freely.  The reasoning for the drop, stated by Grimmie, is that the label was being over burdened by other "big names" they had obligations to.  Despite this setback, Grimmie diligently started work on her new album and released her next single "Cliche" (Mar. 16 2015).  Following "Cliche", Grimmie worked on her next single, "Stay With Me"; a collaboration with Diamond Eyes.  "Stay With Me" was overall a hit and ranked five on the iTunes Electronic Charts.

Writing three of the four songs, the Side A EP was produced by Grimmie herself and the theme of the songs involved her own personal struggles she was dealing with.  In an interview with "PopCrush", Grimmie stated: "Side A was a project that I wanted to do, stuff that I produced completely and it was just stuff that I was dealing with. I haven’t had a lot of “hard times” in my life until recently, so I wanted to write about those things and get them out for my fans and not even worry about genre and just make music... Side A is supposed to be a project just from my heart and whatever is happening in my heart at the time". She also started touring with Rachel Platten on her Wildfire Tour from February to March, 2016, where she was able to perform song from her newly released album.
